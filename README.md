# Spring Boot Training
This project serves as training material for Spring Boot v3.0
Prvious knowledge of Java and some toolkits (e.g.: git, maven/gradle) is assumed, but previous Spring and Spring Boot knowledge is not required.

The training is separated in basic and more advanced topics, to be used depending on the needs of the class.

That being said, this is by no means a comprehensive collection of everything Spring Boot can do.
